    <h1> Hi Dad! It's me Piper.</h1>
    <h2>This is my second first webpage. Excuse the quality.</h2>

    <p> If you're wondering why it's so ugly, that may be due to the fact that I have about 1 degree of coding experience.
        I wanted to try writing my own page from the beginning, so I'm just looking at the html file from class and copying the structure over. I did in fact get this font from Adobe fonts tho</p>
    <p>I've also been looking at w3schools, recommended by my teachers. It has a lot of information, helped me put in this great picture...</p>
   
    <p> I love you! <img src="dadcouch.jpg" alt="Dad and Piper on Couch" style="width: 50%;height: auto;"> </p>
